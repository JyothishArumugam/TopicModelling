predecessor consortium groups sole purpose assess potential feasibility effectiveness blockchain order function efficiently overarching government entity led bi weekly meetings report progress address key decisions concerns team learned one one meetings periodically held participant ensure voices heard check meetings need conducted daily weekly important operating entity understand participants distinct standpoint motivation help obtain consensus across consortium liable issues arise within production blockchains inherently distributed designated entity must oversee solution technology management perspective example software exploit identified update causes performance issues participants network cannot directly held liable determining liability easily achieved following
