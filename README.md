# TopicModelling
Topic modelling and FDAG chart creation stating the relationship between the documents and latent relationship

This is a flask Application which collects data from various sources and then create the LDA allocation for the document
relationship. This LDA is gibbs LDA in C++ which can be found under  the src/ directory. The user can use the application 
by running the app.py and the UI will be generated for the term. As of now the data models are published with the blockchain 
search term alone.
